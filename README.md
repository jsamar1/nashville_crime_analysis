The open sourcing of governmental data has opened up many different avenues for data analysis. It allows citizens and researchers the ability to identify trends or stories in the data that can inform individuals or policy makers of previously unknown information. One area of increased interest is around policing activity. There has been a general discontentment around police behavior in the United States over the last few years. As such I work to analyize the police actions within Davidson County over the last 7 years. This is enabled through a hierarchical clustering algorithm, HDBSCAN. This clustering allows for generating clusters at high density areas and ignoring low density areas, thus is able to generate identifiable crime hot-spots.  This information can be used by citizens wishing to avoid more dangerous areas, and by policy makers to identify trends over the years for informing them on their legislative decisions.
